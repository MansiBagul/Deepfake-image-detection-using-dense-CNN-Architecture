# Deepfake-image-detection-using-dense-CNN-Architecture
This project utilizes state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to detect deepfake images with well accuracy. Leveraging the power of EfficientNetV2B0 architecture implemented in TensorFlow and Keras, this solution is designed to efficiently classify images as either authentic or manipulated.




The Streamlit interface provides a user-friendly platform for uploading images and receiving instant authenticity feedback, enhancing accessibility for users.
